## Multiple Sets of Dancers

At some point we might want to model more that one sey of dancers at a
time.  We woild want to associate each dancer with the set they are
in.  We want to keep Dancer immutable though.

We might provide each dancer with a field for the coordinates of its
flagpole center.  That would allow us to identify which dancers are in
the same set.
